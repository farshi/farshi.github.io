<ul>
<li>is A web service that gives you access to a message queues.</li>
<li>Queues can be used to store messages while waiting for a computer to process them.</li>
<li>is distributed Queue System.</li>
<li>is fast and reliable</li>
<li>A queue is a temporary repository for messages hat are waiting processing.
*By using SQS you can decouple the components of an application so they run independently.</li>
<li>Messages can contain up to 256KB of text in any format.</li>
<li>Messages can be retrieved by any distributed component by using Amazon SQS API.</li>
<li>Amazon SQS ensures delivery of each message at least once. so one message can be read by many distributed application components simultaneously. And They are remained until you remove them from the queue yourself.</li>
<li>SQS does not support FIFO ( First In Firs Out).</li>
<li>SQS is a pull system , and messages are not pushed out like SNS.</li>
<li>Visibility time out period for a message starts when a component retrieves the message. The default visibility time out is minimum 30 seconds and maximum 12 hours.</li>

    <link href="http://www.farshidesigns.com/blog/2015/04/27/amazon-vpc/"/>

    <id>http://www.farshidesigns.com/blog/2015/04/27/amazon-vpc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some Notes about the Amazon VPC service. You will find it useful if you want to prepare for AWS architecture certificate exam.</p>

<p>Amazon VPC:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is like a virtual data center in cloud.</li>
<li>lets you provision a logically isolated sections of the Amazon web service (AWS) cloud.</li>
<li>you have complete control over your virtual network environment.</li>
<li>you can select your own IP address range.</li>
<li>you can create your subnets.</li>
<li>you can configure route tables.</li>
<li>you can setup network gateways ( Internet gateway and Customer gateway).</li>
<li>With VPC you have two level of security:

<ul>
<li>  instance security groups.</li>
<li>  subnet network access control lists (ACLS)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using Amazon Direct Connect you can connect your corporate data center and your AWS VPC.</li>
<li>There is a default VPC which is user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances.</li>
<li>All Subnets in default VPC have an Internet gateway attached.</li>
<li>Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP addresses.</li>
<li>If you delete the default VPC the only way to get it back is to contact AWS.</li>
<li>you can user VPC Peering to connect one VPC with another.</li>
<li>when you use VPC Peering , instances behave as if they were on the same private network.</li>
<li>you can peer even VPC&rsquo;s with other AWS accounts.</li>
<li>Peering is in a star configuration.So Siblings VPC&rsquo;s can not directly talk to each other and should use centric one.</li>
<li>Elastic IP addresses, Internet Gateways, VPCs per region : Max 5</li>
<li>VPC connections per region, Customer Gateways per region: Max 50</li>
<li>Route tables per region: Max 200</li>
<li>Security groups per VPC: Max 100</li>
<li>Rules per security group: Max 50</li>
<li>Dedicated VPC&rsquo;s are expensive because all of instance underneath will be dedicated.</li>
<li>When you create a VPC, one route table and one ACL will be created automatically.</li>
<li>Your subnets can not be in different availability zones , just in one AZ.</li>
<li>you can have only One Internet gateway per VPC.</li>
<li>putting an instance in a public subnet is not enough to make public access to that instance.you should assign public IP address to it to make it accessible from the Internet.</li>
<li>For making a NAT instance as a router for routing private subnet traffic to the Internet you should disable source/destination check for that NAT instance.</li>
<li>Access Control list act as firewall and rules are applied to the entire subnet.
*If you don&rsquo;t associate a ACL to a subnet, default ACL which allows all incoming and outgoing traffic will be assigned to a subnet automatically.</li>
<li>Rules in ACL assigned order numbers, so rule #100 evaluated before rule #200. Amazon recommends to increment rules number by 100.</li>
<li>When you create a new ACL, incoming and outgoing traffic is denied by default.</li>
<li>Like as a firewall , Only one ACL can be assigned to the subnet.cardinality between ACL-Subnet is Many to one.</li>
<li>Amazon corporate network is segregated from AWS network.</li>
<li>Port scanning is not allowed in AWS by default. for vulnerability scan you must request it from amazon for a short period.</li>
</ul>
