Every time I was reading some professional hackers blogs, I thought to myself how good it would be if I had my own weblog and  streamed my thoughts through it.

Today I'm so happy and proud of myself coz finally I decided to create my own weblog. I believe in this:


{% blockquote Lao Tzu %}

Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.

{% endblockquote %}
