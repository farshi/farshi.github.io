Hi, My name is Reza Farshi. I am a software engineer, certified scrum  master and certified Amazon Solution architect. I am passionate about delivering quality software using agile techniques.
I am mainly focused on software architecture with nearly 15 years experience in enterprise application design and development, utilizing Open source, Java, Cloud Computing, and agile methodologies to deliver scalable, reliable and secure enterprise applications.

My favorite sport is Paragliding. Paragliding gives me a natural feel of flying and freedom. I enjoy flying at some weekends when I'd like to make myself away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
